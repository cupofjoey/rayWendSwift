//: Declare a constant tuple that contains three Int values followed by a Double. Use this to represent a date (month, day, year) followed by an average temperature for that date.
let fourTuple = (1, 2, 1945, 56.5)
//: Change the tuple to name the constituent components. Give them names related to the data that they contain: month, day, year and averageTemperature.
let anotherFourTuple = (month: 1, day: 2, year: 1945, averageTemperature: 56.5)
//: In one line, read the day and average temperature values into two constants. Youâ€™ll need to employ the underscore to ignore the month and year.
let(_, day, _, averageTemperature) = anotherFourTuple
//: **Ub3r H4ck3r Challenge** - Create a variable called tuple and inside of it add a tuple. This tuple contains two other tuples. The first tuple has two strings: your first and last name.

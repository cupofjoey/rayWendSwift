//: Create a constant called myAge and initialize it with your age. Write an if statement to print out Teenager if your age is between 13 and 19, and Not a teenager if your age is not between 13 and 19.

let myAge = 18
if myAge >= 13 && myAge <= 19 {
  print("Teenager")
} else {
  print("Not a Teenager")
}

//: **Ub3r H4ck3r Challenge** - Expand this if statement to print out the categories and subcategories of an age. For all ages greater than 19, print out "Adult". For ages between 40-65 print "Middle Age" and for ages higher than 65, print out "Senior Citizen". For all ages, less than thirteen, print "Pre teen". For ages between "1-4", write "toddler" and for ages between 5-12, write "Child".

if myAge <= 12 {
  print("Pre-teen")
